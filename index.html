    <h1> IGOR IS AOTY</h1>
    <h3>By: Gabe M.</h3>
    <p>IGOR, a most anticipated album by tyler the creator, released on May 17th 2019 <br />
    was a totally new project for the artist that allowed him to get his musical creativity to the max, even though he <br />
    was worried how the album would be received. It is a very experimental record, with a mix of 80's punk and RnB soul with a lot of synths <br />
    as it is Tylers' trademark. </p>
